    skill: "Python",
    about:
      "Python was the first programming language that I ever used. I started learning it in high school. During ym time overseas when i decided I wanted to learn to code again python was the first language I went to. I completed the book Learn Python The Hard Way which plunged me back into the realm of computer science. I also used python during university for a data analysis class as well as my machine learning and AI class which helped me gain a much deeper understanding of the language and some much more advanced topics.",
  },
  {
    skill: "Java",
    about:
      "Java was the first language where things really started to click. We used Java throughout university, this helped me gain a large amount of experience and an advanced understanding of object orientated programming. We also used it for creating games, writing advanced NP algorithms, creating concurrent algorithms and many more use cases.",
  },
  {
    skill: "JavaScript",
    about:
      "I had very little experience with Javascript until I started my job at the New Zealand Exchange. Not long after I was writing code in Javascript everyday, because I had the fundamentals from learning Java and python I found it very easy to pick up this new language. I now use it every day to write simple functions to assist website functionality to more advanced algorithms for manipulating data and send asynchronous api calls.",
  },
  {
    skill: "TypeScript",
    about:
      "Coming from Java I found javascript's loosely typed nature somewhat concerning and error prone. Typescript was the obvious solution to this problem. After introducing it into one of the projects at work I quickly fell back into the habit of setting data types. ",
  },
  {
    skill: "React",
    about:
      "I first tried react in 2017 after spending some time working on pure html/css websites. Although it was challenging as I didn't have a huge understanding on javascript and oop languages I really liked the concept of breaking down the html into components as I found pure html would get very long. It also allowed for javascript functionality to be added directing into each component creating are really good level of separation. It quickly become my favorite tool for web development.",
  },
  {
    skill: "Ruby",
    about:
      "I learnt ruby during my time at the New Zealand Exchange, I fou8nd the concepts simple as it follows an object oriented design which is similar to other languages I had already learnt. ",
  },
  {
    skill: "Ruby on Rails",
    about:
      "I learnt Ruby on Rails at the same time as Ruby as it was used in one of the old applications we were re-writing. We also used it as a standalone api which allowed me to gain experience writing api end points that retrieve data from a database or call other apis.",
  },
  {
    skill: "Swift",
    about:
      "I decided I wanted to learn a new language and chose Swift as it would allow me to build ios app. Although the syntax is slightly different to languages such as Java the concepts are similar. I did find it slightly harder to pick up as it was learning it at the same time as I was learning to create fully functioning apps withe modes/views and backend functionality.",
  },
  {
    skill: "C++",
    about:
      "I used c++ for one of my university papers. I found the basic concepts easy enough to understand from the get go as well as the object orientated nature of the language.",
  },
  {
    skill: "C",
    about:
      "During my second year of university we used C for a Systems Programming paper that involved low level programming adn writing code for embedded systems. During teh course I learnt a lot about the programming functionality that is normally handled automatically in higher level languages such as Java. This involved learning how pointers work, memory allocation and manual garbage collection to name a few. This is a language I want to learn more about due to its complex nature that allows for programs to be precise and efficient across teh board.",
  },
  {
    skill: "HTML",
    about:
      "When I decided to give web development a go html was the first place I started, although it is a simple structural language I gained the fundamentals I need which would help in many cases down the line when taking on bigger web applications. After using html in industry for around a year I have a much better understanding of the markup language.",
  },
  {
    skill: "CSS",
    about:
      "I started using css at the same time as html. I found the fundamentals very simple and slowly got used to writing concise css code for all my styling needs. Over the years of personal use and industry use I have gained more experience as well as some more advanced use cases for styling small single pages applications to large scale react projects.",
  },
  {
    skill: "React Native",
    about:
      "During the last year of university I took a class called Software Development for Mobile Platforms which involved creating a mobile app using react native. Because I already had extensive knowledge of the react framework I was able to understand the structure very quickly as it follows very similar patterns. I was able to create a fulls scale mobile app with authentication, full CRUD database capabilities, multiple interactive views, state management and more in only a couple of weeks.",
  },
  {
    skill: "Android Studio",
    about:
      "The second part of the mobile development course I did at university involved using Android Studios to create an app. Because the underlying language is Java it only took a few hours to understand the framework structure and then I was able to start developing.",
